        <h2> The Shuja Cemetery </h2>

        THE HORSE WAS BEHAVING perfectly, streaking across the plain in a dead straight line. Alex had thought he would have to stop to release the parachute, but rocks and spiky plants had ripped the fabric to shreds in a few seconds so that only the cords were left trailing behind. It seemed to him that everything had changed. After its ordeal, plummeting through the air, the horse had decided that perhaps Alex knew what he was doing after all and was now obeying his every command. Alex felt more comfortable in the saddle. They were going so fast that, when he looked down, the sand and wild grass swept past in little more than a vague green blur, but he no longer had the feeling that he was going to fall off. He had lost the riding crop as they came down, but he had no need of it. He was clutching the reins, keeping his head low, feeling the breeze rush over his shoulders.

He had no real idea where he was going. Back in London, Mrs. Jones had shown him a map with the location of the Shuja cemetery, but at that time he hadn’t thought he would need it. He was meant to be arriving there in the back of a van. He remembered her drawing a straight line with her finger, the direction southwest. She had also mentioned a village with a minaret, five miles on the other side. Alex couldn’t be certain, but he had seen where the sun had risen and had guessed that he was heading southwest. Also, there was definitely something tall and narrow on the horizon, although he couldn’t make it out yet. A minaret? He would know once he got closer.

He risked a glance back over his shoulder. The three jeeps were making their way down the winding track, going as fast as the hairpin bends would allow them. They already seemed a long way behind him, but Alex felt a tightening in his stomach. Once the jeeps reached the bottom, they would accelerate, and it might take them ten or fifteen minutes to catch up with him. And he didn’t really have anywhere to go. He doubted that Rafiq and his men would be waiting for him at the cemetery, and it was unlikely that he would find a hiding place among the gravestones. There was always Mrs. Jones’s village—but why would anyone there want to help him? The plain that surrounded him could hardly have been more desolate. He had the mountains behind him, an almost empty horizon ahead. He seemed to be pinned down by the sunlight. He could already feel it burning the back of his neck. The horse was doing its best, and it was a miracle that it hadn’t been hurt when it came into contact with the land. But it would soon get tired. Alex’s earlier euphoria had soon worn off. Things were looking hopeless once again.

He kept going. What other choice did he have? He heard the chime of a bell and turned in time to see a herd of goats scattering as he thundered past. There was no sign of any farmer or goatherd. There wasn’t anyone for miles around. He looked back. The jeeps had already left the track and were racing across the plain, sending up clouds of dust behind. He could even hear the engines. They were only a mile away . . . maybe less. He might have overestimated how much time he had left. He kicked in with his heels and felt the horse jolt forward, doing its best. The poor creature had little energy left. Its flanks were shiny with sweat. There was a part of Alex that felt sorry for what he had put it through, and the last thing he wanted was to see it gunned down. Even as the thought flickered through his head, he heard a gunshot. It was too far away to cause him any alarm, but it was a warning. The soldiers had him in their sights and they were getting closer with every second that passed.

He saw the cemetery. As he approached, it waved and shimmered, forming itself out of the heat haze. It was just stuck there, out on its own. No roads led to it. There were no signs, no indication that anyone had even noticed it existed. Alex saw the remains of a low, square wall built out of mud bricks. There were wide gaps where sections of it had collapsed, eaten away by the constant heat. About thirty or forty gravestones stood grouped together on the other side, with clumps of spiky wild grass and shrubs growing between them. Even as he hurtled toward it, Alex saw that there was something terribly sad about the place. These were British soldiers who had been buried here, victims of a war that had long been forgotten. Who were they? How had they died? They had come here in their bright red tunics, their white belts and helmets, marching into a country they couldn’t begin to understand, and they had never returned home. This was where they lay, and even their names were gone, fading away, wiped clean off their headstones by the relentless desert sun.

Nobody was waiting for him. He saw that at once. There were no horses, no men. Rafiq and the other Kochis had decided to go home. He glanced back and saw that the jeeps had halved the distance between him and them. If someone took a shot at him now, there was every chance he would be in range. What should he do? He could see the village on the other side of the cemetery, a collection of dusty houses gathered around a crumbling minaret. Was there any point continuing, or should he simply accept his fate and give himself up?

As if to answer the question, the horse stumbled and Alex was thrown off. There was nothing he could do to stop it. He felt his body separating from the saddle, and next he was turning in the air, his arms in front of him, desperately trying to protect himself. He crashed down. Fortunately the ground was soft, a mixture of dust and sand. He rolled over twice and came up spitting and coughing. He knew at once that nothing was broken. The horse wheeled away and continued around the side of the cemetery, and Alex wished it luck. At least it would be out of range when the soldiers arrived.

They were almost onto him. Alex heard the jeep engines and the sound of the wheels bumping over the plain. He saw the faces, bearded and angry, behind the windows. Faisal was with them! Alex saw him sitting in one of the front passenger seats. He must have joined them, wanting to take revenge on Alex for what had happened outside the cell. As the jeep slowed to a halt, he was the first one out, bringing up the pistol—old-fashioned, also Russian-made—that he had carried with him. Bruised and exhausted, Alex backed into the Shuja cemetery. He was surrounded by dead British soldiers. It was somehow fitting that, quite soon, a dead British spy would join them.

Darcus Drake’s soldiers came pouring out of the jeeps, moving more slowly now. They had caught up with Alex. They knew he had nowhere to go. Alex had expected Drake to come with them, but he wasn’t going to put himself outside the safety of Falcon’s Edge. The commanding officer was a wiry, curly-haired man in his twenties. He had a broken nose, and a beard sprouted unevenly on both sides of his face. He was holding a machine gun, and Alex wondered if he had been ordered to finish it here or to bring him back so that they could make their film.

“Alex Rider,” he said. He spoke the words as if for the first time, as if he didn’t know what they meant.

The gunshot, when it came, was loud and incredibly close. Alex flinched, expecting to feel the pain—in his chest, in his stomach, wherever he had been shot. Then he realized that the bullet had come from behind him. A red hole had appeared in the commanding officer’s head. He fell back, dropping the machine gun.

“Get down, Alex!”

The words, in English, were shouted out of nowhere. Instinctively, Alex obeyed. There were more shots. Two more of Drake’s men died.

Alex twisted around and looked behind him, staring in amazement as dusty figures rose up like zombies, climbing out of the graves. His first thought was that the ghosts of the nineteenth-century soldiers were rising up to save him, but he knew at once that it was simpler than that. Rafiq and his men had been waiting for him after all. They had used the old graves as hiding places, covering themselves with a thin layer of sand. Now the four of them were revealing themselves, firing at the soldiers with guns they had been clutching all the time. Surprise was on their side. Another six men had been shot and killed before they understood what was happening.

Faisal was not one of them. Alex saw that he had not fired yet, although he too was armed with an AK-47 and could have taken out Rafiq and the others with a single burst. Could it be that he was reluctant to turn on his former friends? There was the click of a gun being loaded. Alex twisted and saw another of Drake’s men just a few steps away, pointing a pistol directly at his head. He knew what was about to happen. He saw it in the man’s eyes. Somehow the tables had turned. Alex had reached the cemetery and his friends were here, waiting for him. Half of Drake’s men had been killed. But whatever happened, the English boy was not going to get away. This man had decided it. He was going to kill him now.

The commanding officer had dropped his machine gun. It was lying on the ground, just inches away. Alex dived for it. But before he could reach it, Faisal stepped forward and Alex saw the white flame as his machine gun spat out its thirty rounds in a matter of seconds. But he wasn’t aiming at Alex. He wasn’t aiming at Rafiq. Impossibly, he was shooting Drake’s men, including the one who had been about to finish Alex. Alex saw him blasted off his feet.

And then it was over, as suddenly as it had begun. All the Kochis—including Rafiq and Faisal—were alive. So was Alex. Only one of Drake’s men was moving. Alex turned away as Rafiq finished him with a single shot.

Faisal was on his side?

It couldn’t be true. But as Alex got to his feet, Rafiq was embracing him, the two men laughing. The other Kochis had gathered around in a group hug. And Alex had seen it for himself. Faisal had just saved his life. He had taken out half a dozen of Drake’s men. What was going on?

“English boy!” Faisal exclaimed, seeing him. He was beaming, which was odd, because the last time they had met, Alex had kicked him hard where it hurt.

“Can someone explain what’s happening?” Alex asked.

“Ask no questions, my friend.” It was Rafiq who had spoken. And suddenly he was speaking perfect English. “We have a long journey to the border, and there is a helicopter that waits. Ask your questions when you are home.”

Questions. Yes. The more Alex thought about it, the more he had to ask.
