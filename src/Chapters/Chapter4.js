        “ALL RIGHT, ALEX. YOU can turn around now.”

Keeping his hands above his head, Alex did just that. He felt the gun move away from the back of his skull, but as he turned full circle, he saw it pointing directly between his eyes, a silver TT-33 self-loading pistol—made in Russia, like the calutron. One twitch of a finger, and it would fire a 7.62 mm bullet, traveling at four hundred yards per second, into his head.

The man whose finger was now curled between life and death was smiling. He had only just been roused from his bed. Alex could tell that from the stubble on his cheeks, the untidy silver hair, and the gray eyes that hadn’t quite shaken off their sleep. He was in his mid-thirties and reminded Alex of a long-distance runner, very slim and light on his feet. He was wearing a loose-fitting black tracksuit with a T-shirt. This had to be Darcus Drake. As Drake stood facing him, Alex’s first thought was that this was an unusually handsome and very confident man. It was only as the seconds ticked past that he realized something was wrong. Drake was still smiling. His expression hadn’t changed, as if the photographer had been photographed himself. And the smile was only on his mouth, not in his eyes. There was nothing friendly about it, nothing humorous. It was simply there.

He was not alone. There were three soldiers surrounding him, watching Alex with deeply hostile eyes.

“You must be Alex Rider,” Drake said.

“Yes.” There seemed to be little point denying it.

“And you got in through the ventilation system?” He laughed softly, but the smile remained the same. “I have to say, I really hadn’t seen that one coming. It must have been a tight squeeze, even for you. Anyway, it’s very early and you must be hungry. Why don’t we have breakfast together?” He glanced at the guards and spoke to them rapidly in Farsi. Then he turned back to Alex. “I’ve told them to take everything you’ve brought with you and to give you a new set of clothes. I’m afraid we may not have anything very stylish, but I’m not taking any chances, not when you’ve been equipped by MI6. Once they’ve done that, they’ll bring you to me.”

“How did you know I was here?” Alex didn’t expect Drake to answer, but he had to know if he had made a mistake.

To his surprise, Drake seemed to be amused by the question. At least, his eyes lit up even if the rest of his face refused to move. “Well, I suppose you deserve to know that, after all your effort,” he said in his lilting Irish accent. He gestured with one hand and a fifth man appeared, coming down the metal steps. Alex recognized him at once: the unpleasant white eye, the beard, the turban. It was Faisal, the tribesman who had ridden with him into the mountains.

“You should be careful whom you choose to trust,” Drake said. “That’s the trouble with the Kochis, Alex. They’ve been fighting so many different people, they don’t really care which side they’re on. Whoever’s got the money, that’s all that interests them.”

“Alex Rider. England spy,” Faisal muttered, as if there could still be any doubt of it.

“I’ll see you very shortly for breakfast,” Drake continued, still addressing Alex. “And don’t worry. I won’t be inviting your friend. In fact, now that I think about it, he probably isn’t your friend anymore. Take it easy. If you try to fight with my men, they’ll break your arms, and we wouldn’t want that.”

He turned and left. The soldiers closed in.

An hour later, escorted by two guards and wearing a dark green uniform that was one size too large for him, Alex was taken back through the great cavern beneath the citadel. His backpack, his belt, his camera, his shoes . . . everything that he had brought with him had been removed. He had no socks, and there were rough leather sandals on his feet. He missed his combat boots more than anything else. He might get a chance to make a break for it—but there was no way he could make any fast moves the way he was dressed now.

Everything was very different. Sunlight was streaming in through the opening and the whole place had woken up, with soldiers everywhere, many of them training on the outer platform, others carrying crates, cleaning weapons. Alex saw that the three supply vans had arrived. One of them was white with a green cross, and he saw the driver, a dark, hooded man, staring in his direction. This must be Farshad, the man who was supposed to smuggle him out of here. Well, it wasn’t going to happen. There was no way the two of them were going to make contact. More soldiers were helping to empty the vehicles, carrying fresh provisions—meat, vegetables, sacks of grain—into the compound. The horses were kicking impatiently, anxious to be on the move.

The guards led him toward a stone staircase on the other side of the burned-out helicopter. Alex hadn’t noticed the staircase when he was there before. A hand shoved him hard in the back and he staggered up, climbing about fifty steps and emerging in a vaulted hallway with brick walls and chandeliers filled with candles. The citadel was a strange mix of ancient and modern. As Alex continued down a long, windowless corridor, electric light bulbs lit the way, but the flagstones under his feet could have been medieval. They came to a curved wooden door and one of the guards knocked, then entered without waiting for an answer.

Darcus Drake had living quarters directly above the open terrace looking out over the plain. The room was huge and austere with a very old, solid table and twelve chairs, a stone fireplace, and rough afghan rugs laid out on the floor. A fire had been lit but the room was cold. Alex noticed that there was no glass in the windows, and although the sun was now well up in the sky, he could still feel the chill of the night. There were maps on the wall: the local area, the country, the whole Middle East. This was the sort of room where wars were planned. He wondered who had sat around this table and what horrors they had discussed.

The two guards waited by the door. Alex stepped forward.

Drake was alone, waiting for him. Breakfast had already been brought up, and despite everything, Alex had to admit it looked good. There were eggs cooked with vegetables, sweet bread, pastries, cheese, dried fruit, and black tea—or chai, as it was called. Less welcome was the sight of his backpack with the contents scattered over the rugs. The computer, the vapor torch, the belt, the boots were all there. Drake was turning over the Leica camera in his hands. The smile was still on his face, exactly as before.

“This is a really fantastic camera,” he said, and Alex remembered what Mrs. Jones had told him. Before he had become a terrorist, Drake had been a professional photographer. “I’m quite surprised, MI6 giving it to a kid like you. No offense.”

“They wanted good photographs,” Alex said.

“Of the calutron?” Drake sneered at him. “Well, that’s a waste of time, Alex. I can’t get the bloody thing to work. Not that I need it. I’ve got much bigger plans.” He set the camera down in front of him. “I’ll keep this, if you don’t mind. It’ll be something to remember you by.”

Alex didn’t like the sound of that. “If you want to steal the camera, I can’t stop you,” he said. “And if it makes you smile . . .”

The gibe struck home. Drake’s eyes darkened. “You’ve noticed that, have you?” He pointed to his mouth. “It’s called Möbius syndrome. It’s a very rare nervous disease, a sort of facial paralysis. I was born with it. It’s funny, really. I’ve been smiling all my life, even though I’ve never found very much to smile about.”

“A bit like the Joker in Batman,” Alex said. He was being deliberately offensive. He didn’t want Drake to think he was scared.

“And who does that make you? Robin?” Drake shook his head. “I don’t think so . . .” He gestured at the table. “Why don’t you sit down? I promised you breakfast and you might as well enjoy it. It’s going to be your last meal.”

Alex felt a hollowing in his stomach as he took his place at the table. He had been threatened with death before. The last time, it had been Dr. Grief who had wanted to cut him up in a biology class at the Point Blanc Academy. But now he was thousands of miles away from home. He had been betrayed. MI6 had no way of knowing what was happening. This wasn’t looking good.

“I have to ask you some questions,” Drake said. “I already know most of the answers. Faisal has told me everything. So if you lie to me, I’ll know at once, and then, I’m afraid, I’ll give you to my men, who will do horrible things to you. This is Afghanistan, Alex. These people can be terribly cruel.”

“What do you want to know?” Alex asked. He helped himself to some bread and cheese. He didn’t feel like eating but was determined to try.

“You know, I’d heard a whisper that MI6 had employed a teenager. Was it you who took out Herod Sayle?”

“Yes.” Alex muttered the single word. The first time he had worked for MI6, he had been sent to Cornwall, where the Stormbreaker computers were being manufactured, and in the end Herod Sayle had died. But he wasn’t going to add any details if he could help it.

“That’s very impressive. How many times have you worked for them since then?”

“This is the third time.”

“Third time unlucky. You should have said no.”

“They didn’t give me much choice.”

“That’s a shame. Why did they pick on you?”

“They wanted photographs of the calutron. The only way in was through the pipes.”

“And the pipes are too narrow for a fully grown man?”

“Yes.”

“What were they going to do with the photographs?”

“They wanted to show them to the United Nations. They needed authorization. To bomb you.”

Drake laughed delightedly. “It’s very difficult to bomb me, Alex. First they have to find me, and I move around a lot. You’ve done well, so far. I’ve got just one more question. Did they tell you I would be here?”

Alex hesitated. He didn’t want to help Drake, but neither did he want to be tortured. In the end, he decided that he had no choice. It probably wouldn’t be that important anyway. “Yes,” he said. “They thought you might be here.”

“I’m surprised they didn’t send you in to kill me.”

“I wish they had,” Alex said.

Drake laughed a second time. “You’re a boy with spirit. I’ll give you that! I’m very sorry it’s had to end this way, Alex. For you, I mean. But I’ve got no more questions. You can eat your breakfast now, and while we’re together, I’m going to tell you what’s going to happen, although I doubt that you’ll like it. What do you say?”

“I’ll have some tea, if you don’t mind.”

“Of course.” Drake poured. Then he began to talk. “You were wasting your time, Alex. They can’t bomb me, whatever they may have told you. The walls of Falcon’s Edge are too thick and the caverns are too deep. They’d need to send a smart bomb in through the window, but I’m not sure they’ve got a bomb that’s smart enough for that. What other options are there? A drone? I have two hundred men surrounding me, my own personal bodyguard. They’d shoot it down before it got anywhere near me. There’s only one track that climbs up from the valley and I make sure it’s well protected. And anyway, like I told you, I’m not here very often. I move around. That’s what keeps me safe.

“I want you to understand who I am. I used to be a newspaper photographer. I’m sure they told you that. I was born in Dublin and I spent five years working for the Irish Times before I moved to London. After that, I was sent to villages all over the Middle East, taking pictures after they’d been targeted by the British and the French and the Americans. Do you know what it does to you, after a while, recording all that misery? Dead people. Destruction. It gets to your head, Alex, and in the end, I realized that I couldn’t do it anymore, supplying nice people like you or your mom and dad with pictures to look at while you’re having breakfast.”

“I don’t have a mom or a dad,” Alex said. “You don’t know anything about me.”

Drake ignored him. “I’m doing something amazing. I’m organizing an army. You see, the whole of the Middle East is crawling with freedom fighters—but there are too many of them, too many different groups. Every country has got half a dozen different factions and they’re all too busy fighting each other to see that the real enemy is laughing at them. The West! The billionaires who sell the weapons and buy the oil. That’s who they should be fighting. And here’s the funny thing. They’re listening to me. I speak their language and I understand their needs. They’ve accepted me as their leader, and quite soon, they’ll come together in a new organization that will stretch from here to Iran, Iraq, Libya, Pakistan, and Syria. I’ve called it the Awakening. It has weapons. It has money. And quite soon it will launch a campaign of terror that will be unlike anything that has gone before.”

“Why do you think killing people will make any difference?” Alex asked. “Don’t you think enough people have been hurt already?”

“You’re just a kid. You don’t understand.” Drake scowled but only with his eyes. His smile remained frozen in place. “I can see I’m wasting my time talking to you, which is a shame because, you know, I’d heard so much about you. But you can still be useful to me.”

He picked up a pastry and tore it in half.

“Here’s what I’m going to do,” he went on. “We’ll wait until sunset. It’ll be more dramatic then, with a red sky. And then we’ll take you outside and put you in front of a firing squad. We’re going to execute you as a spy, Alex. And we’ll film the whole thing. You’ll be on the news. Your friends at school will watch you die. And the film will remind the whole world of the sort of dirty tricks that the intelligence services play, sending schoolboys to do their work for them. It’ll also show them that the Awakening is here and that we’re in business. It’s a win-win situation for us, Alex, although I suppose it’s a lose-lose situation for you. Do you want some more breakfast?”

Alex said nothing. Drake gestured and the two guards came forward and grabbed hold of him. As Alex was led out, Drake picked up the camera and took a couple of shots of him. As always, Drake was smiling.
